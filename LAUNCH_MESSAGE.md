:night_with_stars::metro::rotating_light: MTR Maintenance Tracking - Say goodbye to Excel spreadsheets!

Hello @channel,

MTR, our biggest WeMaintain contract ever, is a different beast that requires special care and attention. Preventive maintenance is scheduled at night on very tight schedules with a lot of scrutiny from the customer. Every unit must be serviced every 14 days, always during night shifts (23:00–05:00), with zero tolerance for missed cycles.

→ That's why we built a dedicated tool to make the life of the team managing preventive maintenance schedules for MTR much easier!

**What it does:**

:calendar: **Visual 14-day calendar** - See all committed maintenance dates at a glance across all 6 MTR zones, no more hunting through massive spreadsheets

:dart: **Drag-and-drop rescheduling** - Move maintenance slots between days and time slots (23:00, 01:30, 03:30) with a simple click, with automatic slot swapping when needed

:file_folder: **Work Order management** - Upload CSV files with automatic slot distribution and validation. The system intelligently assigns 11pm-eligible units to the 23:00 slot and distributes others across the remaining slots

:white_check_mark: **Completion tracking** - Every morning, validate past maintenance with bulk actions. Mark as completed or flag for rescheduling, all in one place

:mag: **Real-time visibility** - Track status (Planned, Pending, Completed, Missed, Rescheduling) with color-coded indicators. Never miss a deadline again

:gear: **Admin panel** - Manage devices, zone mappings, 23:00 slot eligibility, and engineer assignments all from one interface

:link: **Looker integration** - Automatic sync of engineers, devices, and maintenance visits, keeping everything up to date

:speech_balloon: **Chinese notifications** - Automated reminders sent to engineers in Chinese for tonight's schedule and missed committed dates

More control, less back-and-forth, making MTR maintenance scheduling predictable and compliant.

Thank you [team members] for this feature :blue_heart:
