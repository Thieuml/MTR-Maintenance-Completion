## 📊 Current Statistics

### Database Models
- **Zones**: 6 zones (MTR-01 to MTR-06)
- **Equipment**: Synced from Looker (HK only)
- **Engineers**: Synced from Looker (HK only)
- **Schedules**: 14-day cycle maintenance schedules
- **Work Orders**: Uploaded via CSV with automatic slot assignment

### API Endpoints
- **22 API endpoints** implemented
- **4 main pages** (Schedule, Work Order Tracking, Admin, Reschedule)
- **6 admin components** for device and work order management

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
LOOKER_API_BASE_URL=https://wemaintain.cloud.looker.com
LOOKER_CLIENT_ID=...
LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET=...
LOOKER_ENGINEERS_LOOK_ID=160
LOOKER_DEVICES_LOOK_ID=167
LOOKER_VISITS_LOOK_ID=168
NOVU_API_KEY=...
NOVU_API_HOSTNAME=https://eu.api.novu.co
PORT=3004
```

### Looker Integration
- ✅ Engineers: Look ID 160 (filtered on HK)
- ✅ Devices: Look ID 167 (HK only)
- ✅ Visits: Look ID 168 (last 3 months)

### Novu Integration
- ✅ SDK configured
- ✅ Workflows created (not yet triggered)
- ⚠️ Chinese-language templates need to be configured

## 🐛 Known Issues

### 1. **Device Duplication**
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: Normalized equipment numbers to prevent duplicates (e.g., HOK-E1 vs HOK-E01)
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: API now normalizes equipment numbers before comparison

### 2. **23:00 Slot Icon Display**
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: Icon now displays correctly for eligible units
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: Cache invalidation ensures immediate UI updates

### 3. **Work Order Upload Slot Distribution**
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: Work orders now properly distributed across slots
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: 11pm-eligible units correctly assigned to SLOT_2300

## 📋 Next Steps

**📄 See [NEXT_STEPS.md](./NEXT_STEPS.md) for detailed implementation plan**

### Critical Path (Priority 1)
1. **Automated Notifications** ⚠️
   - Set up scheduled jobs to trigger notifications
   - "Tonight Schedule" notifications (daily at 6 PM HKT)
   - "Missed Committed Date" notifications (daily at 7 AM HKT)
   - Test notification delivery

2. **Maintenance Visit Classification** ⚠️
   - Implement auto-classification logic
   - Calculate classification when visit is created/updated
   - Display classification in UI

### Important (Priority 2)
3. **Compliance Dashboard**
   - Overdue units per engineer view
   - Engineer performance metrics (% late visits)
   - Compliance summary

4. **Audit History Export**
   - CSV/PDF export functionality
   - Filter by date range, zone, engineer, status

### Enhancements (Priority 3)
5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Query optimization and caching
   - Bulk operations improvements

6. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Better error handling
   - Mobile responsiveness
   - Loading states

### Future (Priority 4)
7. **EAMS Integration** (when API available)
8. **Advanced Features** (risk detection, automated rescheduling)
